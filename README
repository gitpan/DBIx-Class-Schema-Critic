NAME
    DBIx::Class::Schema::Critic - Critique a database schema for best
    practices

VERSION
    version 0.013

SYNOPSIS
        use DBIx::Class::Schema::Critic;

        my $critic = DBIx::Class::Schema::Critic->new(
            dsn => 'dbi:Oracle:HR', username => 'scott', password => 'tiger');
        $critic->critique();

DESCRIPTION
    This package is used to scan a database schema and catalog any
    violations of best practices as defined by a set of policy plugins. It
    takes conceptual and API inspiration from Perl::Critic.

    dbic_critic is the command line interface.

    This is a work in progress - please see the "SUPPORT" section below for
    information on how to contribute. It especially needs ideas (and
    implementations!) of new policies!

ATTRIBUTES
  class_name
    The name of a DBIx::Class::Schema class you wish to "critique". Only
    settable at construction time.

  schema
    A DBIx::Class::Schema object you wish to "critique". Only settable at
    construction time.

  dsn
  username
  password
    The DBI data source name (required) and optional username and password
    used to connect to the database. If no "class_name" or "schema" is
    provided, DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader will then construct schema classes
    dynamically to be critiqued.

METHODS
  policies
    Returns an array of loaded policy names that will be applied during
    "critique". By default all modules under the
    "DBIx::Class::Schema::Critic::Policy" namespace are loaded.

  critique
    Runs the "schema" through the DBIx::Class::Schema::Critic engine using
    all the policies that have been loaded and dumps a string representation
    of "violations" to "STDOUT".

  violations
    Returns an array reference of all
    DBIx::Class::Schema::Critic::Violations picked up by the various
    policies.
